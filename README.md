# LEMP stack on a Debian server

The latest stable versions of software for a LEMP stack on a Debian server are compiled with an optimized configuration for the best performance, speed of response and security.

The basic usage is
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dertin/lemp-stack-debian.git
cd lemp-stack-debian/
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh all N
```

You must have a domain address before executing the script, so that your https certificate is correctly configured automatically. If you do not have a domain now, enter the domain you are going to buy later, and then manually configure your https certificate.
